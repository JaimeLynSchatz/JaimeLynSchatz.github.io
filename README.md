========================
Here is my home base on the web.

I use this both as a resume/portfolio hosting sight as well as a quickie CDN for quickly sharing pictures and such with remote teams. The directory is rather messy, but I will bring order to the chaos eventually. When I get tired of sweeping up yak sheddings, I'll pick up that particular shaver. :)
