========================
Here is my home base on the web.

I use this both as a resume/portfolio hosting sight as well as a quickie CDN for quickly sharing pictures and such with remote teams. The directory is rather messy, but I will bring order to the chaos eventually. When I get tired of sweeping up yak sheddings, I'll pick up that particular shaver. :)

Until then, my first TODO on the site is to set treeindex as the actual landing page and link out to the resume. Need to be careful about metadata ... need to do a litle SEO research there.
