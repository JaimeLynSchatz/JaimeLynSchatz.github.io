Win-Deck
========
A quick hacked up version of Haiku Deck from the dark times when:
1. There was no Haiku Deck for Windows machines
2. All I had was a Windows machine

Using an antiquated verion of Foundation, I hacked this slider together as part of an application for Haiku Deck. I didn't get the job, but I learned a lot. Originally deployed on Azure. Pulled when my 30 day trial ran out ;). (Ah, the days before I knew about GitHub pages...)
